# MEEM
It's a tool to organize your own meme library by assigning tags to each meme.

## Architecture
MEEM is built with two main parts:
1. **Rust backend:** Handles user authentication, database access and way more.
2. **Android app:** Is the user frontend to access all the fancy memes and to interact with the backend.

## License
This project is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** as stated in the project root.

## Future plans
- Central server hosted by me which collects (only if you agree) meme fingerprints and there user-generated tags, so you don't have to do the heavy lifting if others already did it.
- Angular frontend to browse your precious on your computer.
